### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , I am [Vamsi Bellam](https://vamsibellam.com/)

- I am currently pursuing Master's in Computer Science and Engineering at the University at Buffalo (SUNY)
- I am interested in Programming Languages, Functional Programming, Type Systems and Formal Verification
- Previously, I was a Software Engineer for 2 years at [HBK](https://www.hbkworld.com/en) crafting software for Internal Platform and Applications in the Test and Measurement domain. I have worked on many parts of the software from UIs, Microservices, and Containerization to Cloud Infrastructure. Before that, I spent 6 months at [VIMANA](https://govimana.com/) as a Software Engineering Intern on User Interfaces using React, JS/Flow/TS, and Blueprint.js in the Smart Manufacturing domain.
- I also like teaching and sharing knowledge. I worked as a Teaching Assistant for Software as a Service(SAAS) class at SASTRA University helping students understand and build quality web applications using Git, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, and Heroku. Later, I worked as a Teaching Assistant and then as a Teaching Fellow at Pupilfirst for the [LITE](https://lite.pupilfirst.org/) and [Advanced Web Development](https://wd.pupilfirst.org/) programs.
