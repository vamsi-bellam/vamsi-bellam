## ðŸŽ“ About Me
I am a computer science and engineering graduate student at the University at Buffalo. **I am actively looking for Full-time SDE/SWE opportunities.** If you are looking for someone, please reach out to me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vamsi-bellam/) or email me at vbellam@buffalo.edu

Previously, I was a Software Engineer at [HBK](https://www.hbkworld.com/en) for 2 years crafting software for Internal Developer Platforms and Applications in the Test & Measurement domain. I have worked on many parts of the software from composable User Interfaces(React & TS), Microservices(Java, JS & Python), and Containerization(Docker, Kubernetes, Helm & Bash) to Cloud Infrastructure(Azure & GCP). Before joining HBK, I worked at [VIMANA](https://govimana.com/) on an IOT Analytics Application with React, NodeJs, Kibana, and Grafana.

I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant and then as a Teaching Fellow at Pupilfirst for the [Leadership in Teaching Excellence](https://lite.pupilfirst.org/) and [Advanced Web Development](https://wd.pupilfirst.org/) (as a part of National Education Policy - NEP 2020) programs helping faculty from 136 institutions & more than 1000 students understand and build quality web applications using Git, Ruby, Rails, PostgreSQL, Javascript, NodeJs and ExpressJs.
